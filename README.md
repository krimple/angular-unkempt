(in progress) a simple Google Keep-like project.  Don't look yet :)

I'm working on adding a true model layer to an angular app for demonstration purposes. Why? 
According to a [thought-provoking presentation](http://youtu.be/lHbWRFpbma4) 
by a GoInstant developer recently at Google the model is super important. Angular's 
ViewModel is just that - an adapter to expose your important model objects. But people
get lazy and say "we don't need to create a model." Well, ha. 

Anyway, we'll get something useful going here over the next few weeks. I'm using this as 
one of my proving ground projects for our upcoming AngularJS Directives and Server-side 
access training in the summer and will blog about my research as I continue.
